1. Go for a walk.

2. Write it down – whether it’s your to-do list or what you believe is making you anxious, put pen to paper and get it out of your head and onto the page.

3. Engage your senses: hold a cup of something warm, count the number of leaves you see on a tree, notice the vibrancy of the colors around you. Note: if you often feel anxious, you might want to make your warm drink a cup of herbal tea, rather than coffee. Caffeine can sometimes worsen anxiety.

4. Engage with your loved ones: call a friend, check-in with your significant other, ask someone how they are doing and listen closely to get out of your own experience of anxiety and into the words they are speaking.

5. Sit for three minutes in meditation, eyes closed or softly gazing in front of you. Breathe in for five seconds, hold for five seconds, exhale for five seconds.

6. Tidy your space/home.

7. Pet your dog, cat, hamster, etc.

8. Enlist the help of a therapist to help you get to the root of your anxiety.

9. Watch a comedic TV show or movie.

10. Take a break from social media.
