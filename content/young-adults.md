Are you a 20-something feeling lost in the world as people tell you that this phase of life is supposed to be “fun?” Do you feel paralyzed by indecision? Are you overwhelmed trying to balance continuing education, work, and relationships? Maybe you struggle to form meaningful intimate relationships in the modern age of dating. Or perhaps something from your past is holding you back from creating the life you want in the present. You didn’t think transitioning from adolescence to adulthood would be this hard.

The truth is that transitioning into full-fledged adulthood is difficult. The pressure during this phase of life can often produce anxiety, depression, increased substance use, and interpersonal problems. You don’t have to face this alone.
