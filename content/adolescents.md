Therapy for teens and pre-teens

It can feel helpless to watch your child struggle with depression, identity issues, school problems, or anxiety. It's hard to know the right thing to say or do when your teen is acting out or sometimes worse - "acting in" - and not giving you much to work with at all. Employing the help of a therapist is immensely helpful if your teen or your family is going through a divorce, loss in the family, or some kind of conflict. Giving your teen a safe place to share feelings and problem-solve under the guidance of a compassionate professional is invaluable, especially in these formative years. Psychotherapy with teens requires parental involvement and parents will receive updates on their child's progress throughout the process. 

Common issues addressed in therapy with teens:

* Depression
* Anxiety
* Identity development including LGBTQIA identities 
* Family issues like divorce or loss
* Trauma
* School problems
* Interpersonal problems with friends or family
* Substance experimentation
