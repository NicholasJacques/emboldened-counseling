Emboldened Counseling was designed to provide you the best possible service in the most straightforward way. Finding the right fit for you or your child is the most important element in beginning therapy. I offer a complimentary 15 minute phone consultation so that we can ensure that you are getting the right fit for yourself or your teen. If we decide to work together we will set up an initial session. Therapy is optimal when consistent and I thus strongly recommend sessions on a weekly basis. 

Sessions are 50 minutes in length and $95 per session. I accept cash, check, and credit cards. Credit card payments will incur a small, additional, service charge fee. Please note that I do not accept insurance, largely due to the lack of privacy for you and the restrictions on treatment that companies demand. In this age of managed care, I, as an out-of-network provider, have the freedom and flexibility to practice in the way that we decide together is best for you.
