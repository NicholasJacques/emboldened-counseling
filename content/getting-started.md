Finding the right fit for you or your child is the most important element in beginning therapy. I conduct in-person consultations at the onset of therapy so that you can get a feel for me, my procedures, and my approach. If we choose to work together, then we will set up an initial therapy session. Therapy is optimal when consistent and I thus strongly recommend sessions on a weekly basis.

Sessions are 45 minutes in length and $100 per session. I accept cash, check, and credit cards. Credit card payments will incur a small, additional, service charge fee. Please note that I do not accept insurance, largely due to the lack of privacy for you and the restrictions on treatment that companies demand. If you wish, may check with your provider to see if you are offered out-of-network benefits. In this age of managed care, I, as an out-of-network provider, have the freedom and flexibility to practice in the way that we decide together is best for you.
